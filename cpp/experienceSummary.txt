  Capacity of array is limited. Once I declared "char v[1000000][100]", visual studio 2015 faild to run exe and return error "0x800700c1",
and that exe would never be run again even if you changed the capacity. You can change the capacity and click 
"generate->re-generate exename" to make that exe available again.
